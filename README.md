# Iqbook - Invoice Management System

A modern invoice and accounting management application built with React, TypeScript, and Electron.

## Features

- Customer and vendor management
- Invoice creation and management
- Purchase invoice tracking
- Payment processing
- Quotation management
- Chart of accounts
- Double-entry accounting
- Backup and restore functionality

## Database

The application uses SQLite as its database, stored as a single `.db` file that users can easily backup and restore.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- For desktop app: Electron

### Installation

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild native modules for Electron
npx electron-rebuild
```

### Running the Application

#### Web Version (Development)
```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Desktop App (Development)
```sh
npm run electron-dev
```

#### Desktop App (Production)
```sh
npm run build
npm run electron
```

#### Windows Installer (.exe)
```sh
npm install
npm run build-win
```

This produces a proper NSIS installer such as `BookIt Setup 12.1.0.exe` in `dist-electron/`.
It installs BookIt for offline use and still allows optional LAN connection from the Settings screen.

### Database Location

The SQLite database is stored at:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\invoiceflow\invoiceflow.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/invoiceflow/invoiceflow.db`
- Linux: `~/.config/invoiceflow/invoiceflow.db`
